trevcan's wiki contributions

This is a somewhat miscellaneous repository.

It contains most of my wiki contributions to the open-source / free software
world. 

This is due to the fact that some wikis are not hosted through git and don't
necessarily show the history of it. So this is an attempt at making a history
of my wiki contributions to some projects.

If you have any suggestions, send a patch to my email [0] with the subject
`wiki-contributions PATCH: subject`. 

that is all.
